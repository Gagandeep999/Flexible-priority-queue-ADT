## Self implemented flexible priority queue using arrays.

In a min-heap, the element of the heap with the smallest key is the root of the binary tree. On the other hand, a max-heap has as root the element with the biggest key, and the relationship between the keys of a node and its parent is reversed of that of a min-heap.

In this assignment, your task is to implement your own flexible priority queue ADT using both min- and max-heap in Java. The specifications of the flexible priority queue are provided. The heap(s) must be implemented from scratch using an <b>array that is automatically extendable</b>. You are not allowed to use any list (including arraylist), tree, vector, or heap implementation already available in Java. You must not duplicate code for implementing min- and max-heaps (i.e. the same code must be used for constructing min or max heaps.
